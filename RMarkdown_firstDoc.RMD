## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Heading Size, Italics and Boldening of text in R Markdown

For italicising words, use a single asterisk around the word like *this*.
For boldening words, use double asterisks around the word like **this**.
Heading size is determined by the number of Hashes in front of it. A single hash is the biggest header size, 2 hashes give a slightly smaller heading and so on.
This section's heading uses 3 hashes and the headings of the sections above use double hashes.

## To include code chunks in your R Markdown:
In RStudio, u can use the Insert option and select the lang of the code u want to add like R, Python, SQL, Bash... It will create an empty code chunk.
```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3,4))
```
 
You can also add code chunks by adding 3 reverse ticks '`' and fill your code.

You can also use a shortcut command- Ctrl + Alt +  I. This is to test if it works.
```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

To test your code chunk, you can use Ctrl + Enter or the Run button.
To test multiple lines of code use Ctrl+Shift+Enter or Run button.

## To make bulleted lists:
 Lists are created by proceeding each perspective bullet point by a single dash, followed by a single space and then at the end of each bullets line give 2 spaces.
Like '- first bullet  (2spaces)'
 
#### Bullet list to check:
- My  
- Name  
- Is  
- Swetha  

Not adding 2 spaces after each bullet item may cause some spacing problems.

## To add links:
Enclose the desired link between <>. Like
<https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/134kE/r-markdown>. Note: It is important to use https/http.

To add links to some text, enclose the text in box brackets [] followed by the link in parantheses (). Like:

## To strikethrough text:
Surround the desired word with 2 tilde.
